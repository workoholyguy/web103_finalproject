## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 The Topics Covered in a class have been very useful]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 The volume of work seemed to be more than expected]

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 We have not finished them. Next week we will try to break down the features into smaller more atomic ones, so we can breakup the workload where we're not expected to complete a lot at once]

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 This user story "4.	As an applicant, I want to view all my job applications in a single dashboard so that I can monitor my job search progress easily.", if the item remains at risk, it's worth investigating, how can the workloads be redistibuted for more optimal progress. Additionaly we may reconsider the reach and the depth of the dashboard detailization.]

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Not aware at this time]
