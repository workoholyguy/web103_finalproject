## About

### Description and Purpose

[Job Ledger is a full-stack web application that helps users track their job applications in one organized place. It allows users to log positions, monitor application status, record interview details, and analyze progress toward their career goals. The purpose of Job Ledger is to streamline the job-search process by centralizing all applications, deadlines, and follow-ups in a single dashboard.
